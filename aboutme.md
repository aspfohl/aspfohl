ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My primary interests lie at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning, and especially within healthcare. I've worked as a data & software engineer (@[Amino](https://partners.amino.com/), @[PTXTech](https://ptxtech.com/)) and as a health research programmer (@[Mathematica](https://www.mathematica.org/), @[Georgia Tech Health Analytics](https://www.healthanalytics.gatech.edu/)). Recently, I started my masters in computer science at [Cornell Tech](https://www.tech.cornell.edu) in NYC to focus my expertise within machine learning and data science
